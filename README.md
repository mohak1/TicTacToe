# TicTacToe
A simple 2-player TicTacToe game in C Language.

About this small project:
I created this game when i was learning C (about an yeaer ago!), Im posting this on Github because i recently got to know about it and thought it would fun to upload some old projects and make some new ones too.

This C program uses only if-else conditions for the gameplay, there are no functions made to carry out similar tasks :(
But still this game is fun to play and I personally like it because it was something I created without any help.

I'll make another simple game in C++ or python soon.
